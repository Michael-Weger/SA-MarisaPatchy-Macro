### Purpose
I decided to make this script because I had been looking to learn to use AHK for some time now, but I've always found a script for my purpose online at the ready. Now I'll be able to make more scripts in the future be it for other games or more productive tasks requiring some form of automation. 

If I ever 1CC SA using this script I'd probably feel cheaty about it, but that's unlikely to happen anyway.

### Overview
An AHK macro for playing Marisa+Patchy in Touhou 11: Subterranean Animism

Allows the player to quick cycle between shot types using spacebar and quickly move to specified shot types using other hotkeys.

Using the default method of switching shot types or dying in the middle of a shot type swap will cause the script to desync from gameplay. Players can use the Reset hotkey or the GUI to reset the logical shot type to Fire Sign.

### Hotkeys
* Space: Cycles shot types
* C: Sets the shot type to Fire Sign.
* D: Sets the shot type to Water Sign.
* S: Sets the shot type to Wood Sign.
* A: Sets the shot type to Metal Sign.
* F: Sets the shot type to Earth Sign.
* RControl: Resets the logical shot type to Fire Sign.
